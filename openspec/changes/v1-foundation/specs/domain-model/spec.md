## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Every entity has a validating schema
The system SHALL define a zod schema for each stored entity: Module, Course, Assessment, SourceItem, Task, Change, and Run. Every value written to storage or returned to an agent MUST pass its schema first.

#### Scenario: Valid entity is accepted
- **WHEN** a Task with an id, module id, title, and at least one step is parsed
- **THEN** parsing succeeds and returns a typed value

#### Scenario: Invalid entity is rejected with a path
- **WHEN** a Task without a title is parsed
- **THEN** parsing fails and the error names the `title` path

### Requirement: Entity fields
The schemas SHALL contain at least these fields (ids are non-empty strings; times are ISO 8601 strings):
- Module: `id`, `name`, `glyph`, `auto` (fed by coursework sources).
- Course: `id`, `moduleId`, `code`, `name`, `term`, `assessmentsComplete` (the user or a sync confirmed the assessment list is final).
- Assessment: `id`, `courseId`, `name`, `kind`, `weight`, `score?`, `due?`, `hurdleMin?`, `isFinal`, `status` (`not_started` | `in_progress` | `submitted` | `graded`).
- SourceItem: `id`, `platform` (`canvas` | `ed` | `ical` | `manual`), `externalId`, `courseId?`, `kind` (`assignment` | `announcement` | `material` | `post` | `event`), `title`, `url?`, `text` (already redacted), `contentHash`, `fetchedAt`.
- Citation: `sourceItemId`, `quote`, `locator`.
- Step: `title`, `estimateMinutes`, `done`, `citations` (array, may be empty only for manual tasks).
- Task: `id`, `moduleId`, `courseId?`, `assessmentId?`, `title`, `source` (`coursework` | `manual`), `due?`, `repeat?` (`daily` | `weekly`), `steps`.
- Change: `seq`, `kind`, `entity` (`course` | `assessment` | `source_item` | `task`), `entityId`, `before?`, `after?`, `at`.
- Run: `id`, `command`, `startedAt`, `endedAt`, `steps`, `outcome` (`ok` | `error`), `errorCode?`, `costUsd?`.

#### Scenario: Unknown enum value
- **WHEN** a SourceItem with `platform: "moodle"` is parsed
- **THEN** parsing fails and the error names the `platform` path

### Requirement: Modules are user-defined and delivery-type
A Module SHALL have an id, a name, a glyph, and a flag saying whether it is fed automatically by coursework sources. Module progress SHALL equal completed steps divided by all steps of its non-recurring tasks (decision #31).

#### Scenario: Progress of a module
- **WHEN** a module has two non-recurring tasks with 1 of 2 and 2 of 3 steps done, plus one recurring task
- **THEN** its progress is 3/5 and the recurring task does not count

#### Scenario: Module with no counted steps
- **WHEN** a module has no non-recurring tasks
- **THEN** its progress is 0, not NaN

### Requirement: Assessments carry weight, score, and hurdle floor
An Assessment SHALL belong to a Course and carry a kind (`ongoing`, `assignment`, `exam`), a weight in percent (0–100), an optional score in percent (0–100), an optional due date, an optional `hurdleMin` in percent, and a flag marking the final exam. The weights of one course's assessments MUST sum to 100 when the course has `assessmentsComplete: true`. A course MUST have at most one assessment with `isFinal: true`.

#### Scenario: Weight out of range
- **WHEN** an assessment with weight 120 is parsed
- **THEN** parsing fails

#### Scenario: Course weights do not add up
- **WHEN** a course with `assessmentsComplete: true` has assessment weights summing to 95
- **THEN** validation fails with a message naming the course and the sum

#### Scenario: Two finals
- **WHEN** a course has two assessments with `isFinal: true`
- **THEN** validation fails

### Requirement: Grade projection
The system SHALL compute, for a course: the graded weight, earned points, the current average over graded items, and the final-exam score needed to reach a target band. Ungraded non-final items SHALL be assumed to score the current average. Bands are H1 80, H2A 75, H2B 70, H3 65, P 50.
The result's `need` SHALL be one of: `{ status: "score", value, setByHurdle }`, `{ status: "unreachable" }`, `{ status: "secured" }`, or `{ status: "unavailable", reason }` with reason `nothing_graded`, `no_final`, or `final_graded`. Order of evaluation: compute the raw need; if it is above 100 the status is `unreachable`; otherwise, if the final has `hurdleMin`, the value is `max(raw, hurdleMin)` and `setByHurdle` is true when the floor won (this applies even when raw ≤ 0); otherwise raw ≤ 0 is `secured`. Values are not rounded; tests compare to one decimal place.

#### Scenario: Needed final score
- **WHEN** graded items are 10% at 82, 15% at 88, and 10% at 74, an ungraded 25% assignment exists, the final is 40%, and the target is H1
- **THEN** earned is 28.8, the current average is 82.29 (to two decimals), and the needed final score is 76.6 (to one decimal)

#### Scenario: Hurdle sets the floor
- **WHEN** the same course has a final with `hurdleMin` 40, the assignment is graded 60, and the target is P
- **THEN** the needed final score is 40 and the result marks that the hurdle set it

#### Scenario: Out of reach and secured
- **WHEN** the raw need is above 100, or at most 0 for a final without `hurdleMin`
- **THEN** the status is `unreachable` or `secured` respectively

#### Scenario: Hurdle beats secured
- **WHEN** the raw need is at most 0 and the final has `hurdleMin` 50
- **THEN** the status is `score` with value 50 and `setByHurdle` true

#### Scenario: Nothing graded yet
- **WHEN** a course has no graded items
- **THEN** the current average is null and the need is `unavailable` with reason `nothing_graded`

#### Scenario: No final or final already graded
- **WHEN** a course has no final, or its final already has a score
- **THEN** the need is `unavailable` with reason `no_final` or `final_graded`

### Requirement: Tasks have steps, citations, and recurrence
A Task SHALL belong to a Module, optionally to a Course and an Assessment, and SHALL have one or more steps with an estimate in minutes and a done flag. A Task with `source: "coursework"` SHALL carry, on each step, at least one citation `{ sourceItemId, quote, locator }`. A manual Task SHALL carry no citations. A Task MAY repeat `daily` or `weekly`; a recurring Task has no due date.

#### Scenario: Coursework step without a citation
- **WHEN** a Task whose source is `coursework` has a step with no citation
- **THEN** validation fails

#### Scenario: Recurring task with a due date
- **WHEN** a Task has `repeat: "daily"` and a due date
- **THEN** validation fails

### Requirement: Changes and runs are recorded
A Change SHALL record its kind (`item.added`, `item.removed`, `content.changed`, `deadline.changed`, `grade.changed`), the affected entity, and the before and after values where relevant. Its `seq` is assigned by the store (see `local-store`). A Run SHALL record the command, start and end time, step count, outcome, and an optional cost reported by the caller.

#### Scenario: Change without before or after
- **WHEN** a `deadline.changed` change has neither `before` nor `after`
- **THEN** validation fails
